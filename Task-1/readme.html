#Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

* This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
* You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
* Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
* What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
